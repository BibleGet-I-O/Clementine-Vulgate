          The Clementine Vulgate: plain text
        </h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page is for those who want to convert the text of the Clementine
	Vulgate into a format of their choosing. You can also <a
	  href="gettext.html">view the text online</a>, <a
	  href="cgi-bin/vulsearch">search it</a> and <a href="pdf.html">print
	  it</a> at this site. This document describes the mark-up used, and
	provides copies of the source files together with some sample conversion
	scripts.</p>

	<h3>Download</h3>
	<p>You most probably want the latest source files and sample scripts:</p>
	<div class="pcent" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><a href="latest.zip">Download the
	    latest source file (2/9/06)</a> (1.6&nbsp;Mb)</div>
	<p>However, you can also recreate the text as it stood at any time since
	its release: if you want to do this, you will find instructions <a
	  href="README-patch.txt">here</a> and checksums <a
	  href="checksums.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>All of the scripts are released under the <a
	  href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.html">GPL</a>,
	and can be run using free software (see the Tools section below for
	download links).</p>

	<h3>Description of the markup</h3>
	<p>The text is plain text, codepage 1252, with DOS-style line endings.
	Commas and periods have no space before, and a single space after
	(unless they end a line&mdash;there is never a space at the end of a
	verse), whereas <code>: ; ? !</code> each have a single space before, and a single
	space after (unless they end a line). In general, the first word of a
	verse is not capitalized, nor the first word of a line of poetry, but
	the first word of a sentence, as well as the first word of direct speech
	or quotation, is capitalized.</p>

	<p>The text really has two structures: the traditional division
	into books, chapters and verses, and a 'natural' structure as sentences
	and paragraphs. This latter structure is not an intrinsic part of the
	text, and has been imposed differently by each editor of the Vulgate
	through the centuries; for my part I have tried to use punctuation both
	to make the meaning transparent, and to reflect the natural
	cadences in the text.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Paragraph divisions are indicated by a backslash <code>\</code>, though this is
	  omitted at the very start or end of a chapter. This is followed by a
	  space if it should occur in the middle of a verse.</li>
	  <li>When text is set as verse, the start and end of a section of verse are
	  indicated by brackets <code>[</code> (preceded by a space) and
	  <code>]</code> (followed by a space unless it end
	  the verse) respectively. Line breaks within the verse are indicated by
	  a slash <code>/</code> (followed by a space unless it end the verse).</li>
	  <li>When different speakers are indicated (e.g.&nbsp;in the
	  Lamentations), the speaker's name is placed between angle brackets
	  <code>&lt;&hellip;&gt;</code>, with no space after the closing bracket.</li>
	  <li>Lamentations and Ecclesiasticus have prologues (which I believe
	  are non-canonical?). In the source,
	  this appears at the start of 1:1, though logically it belongs before
	  the start of ch.&nbsp;1. The prologue is preceded by
	  <code>&lt;Prologus&gt;</code> and in both books the text of
	  verse&nbsp;1 begins at the first bracket <code>[</code>.</li>
	  <li>Information on the creators and proof-readers of each book can be
	  found in <code>source/data.txt</code>; a description of the format of
	  this file appears at its head.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The example scripts</h3>
	<p>Included with the source files are some example scripts, which I hope
	might be helpful models for anyone who wants to convert the text into
	another format&mdash;these are the scripts used to produce the HTML and PDF
	versions of the text available on this site. I hope the scripts
	themselves are well enough commented: below is a description.</p>

	<h4>makehtml</h4>
	<p>This consists of two scripts:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A sed script that does the meat of the work: it converts the
	  source files to the body of a valid XHTML document. It should be an
	  easy matter to modify this script to produce XML with whatever tags
	  you want.</li>
	  <li>A perl wrapper round the sed script that adds a header and footer
	  and so on, in order to make a valid complete XHTML document.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To generate the HTML, ensure that perl and sed are in your path, open
	a shell or command window at the <code>clemtext</code> directory, and
	type <code>perl&nbsp;makehtml.pl</code> (the output is placed in the
	<code>html</code> directory).</p>
	
	<h4>makelatex</h4>
	<p>Once again, a sed script does all the work, and a perl wrapper cleans
	things up. There are also two batch files (which are also valid shell
	scripts) to generate two different PDF files from the LaTeX source, one
	("vulgate") A4 paper with wide margins; the other ("twocolumn"), letter
	paper (8.5 x 11") in two columns. To make everything, ensure that perl,
	sed, and pdflatex are in your path, open a shell or command window at
	the <code>clemtext</code> directory and type
	<code>perl&nbsp;makelatex.pl</code>, then
	<code>makepdf-vulgate.bat</code>, then
	<code>makepdf-twocolumn.bat</code> (the output is placed in the
	<code>latex</code> directory).</p>



	<h3>Tools</h3>
	<p>The tools needed to run the scripts described here are a standard
	part of any Linux distribution. Here is a list of sites where Windows
	users can download them freely.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a
	    href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/sed.php">Sed</a></li>
	  <li><a
	    href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl">Perl</a></li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.miktex.org/setup.html">LaTeX</a> (only
	  required to generate PDFs). You will also need some packages, which
	  can be obtained from <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk">CTAN</a>, though
	  MikTeX has an install-on-demand feature, which means you shouldn't need to
	  download them manually.</li>
	</ul>
